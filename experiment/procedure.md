<h1> Calibration of Instruments Using a Potentiometer</h1>

A) Calibrating a Voltmeter Using a Potentiometer

1. Connect the potentiometer to a stable DC power source.
2. Adjust the potentiometer to establish a uniform potential gradient along its length.
3. Determine the balancing length (`l`) on the potentiometer for a known reference voltage (`E`) and calculate the potential gradient (`k = E / l`).
4. Connect the voltmeter in parallel across the potentiometer.
5. Compare the voltmeter reading with the voltage calculated using the potentiometer balancing length.
6. Record any deviations and apply corrections as necessary.
7. Repeat the process for various voltages to check the voltmeter’s accuracy across its range.

B) Calibrating an Ammeter Using a Potentiometer

1. Connect the potentiometer to a stable DC power source.
2. Include a standard resistor (`R`) of known value in the circuit and adjust the potentiometer to produce a measurable voltage (`V`) across `R`.
3. Calculate the current (`I = V / R`) flowing through the circuit using Ohm’s law.
4. Connect the ammeter in series with the circuit to measure the same current.
5. Compare the ammeter reading with the calculated current.
6. Record any deviations and apply corrections as necessary.
7. Repeat the procedure for different current values to verify the ammeter’s accuracy over its range.
