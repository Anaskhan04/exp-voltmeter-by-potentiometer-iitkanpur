<h3>1. Calibration of Ammeter:</h3> 

<p>To calibrate an ammeter, a stable DC supply voltage is used to minimize errors in the calibration caused by voltage fluctuations. A rheostat is used to adjust the magnitude of the current flowing through the circuit. A standard resistance (R) with sufficient current-carrying capacity is placed in series with the ammeter that is being calibrated. This setup allows us to measure a voltage that corresponds to the current flowing in the circuit.</p>

<p>Once the power is turned on, a current <b>I</b> flows through the circuit. The ammeter in the loop will give a reading based on this current. Additionally, a voltage drop will occur across the standard resistance due to the current flow. This voltage drop can be measured using a potentiometer. From this measurement, we can apply Ohm’s Law (<b>I = V/R</b>) to calculate the current flowing through the standard resistance, where:</p>

<h4>                     
<p align="center">
    I = V / R
</p>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b>V</b> = Voltage across the standard resistor,</li>
  <li><b>R</b> = Resistance of standard resistor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the standard resistor is known accurately, and the potentiometer provides an accurate measurement of the voltage, the calculated current will represent the true current in the loop. This value is then compared with the ammeter’s reading to check for accuracy.</p>

<p>In this experiment, the same current is measured using both the potentiometer and the ammeter. When the electromotive force (EMF) of a standard cell is balanced on the potentiometer, we have the following relationship:</p>

<p align="center">
  E = L<sub>1</sub> * x,
</p>

<p>Where <b>x</b> is the potential gradient along the potentiometer wire, and <b>L<sub>1</sub></b> is the length corresponding to the known EMF.</p>

<p>From this, we can find the current <b>I₂</b> by using the formula:</p>

<p align="center">
  I₂ = V₂ / R,
</p>

<p>Where <b>V₂</b> is the voltage across the standard resistor measured by the potentiometer.</p>

<p>After substituting the value for <b>V₂</b> from the relationship, we get:</p>

<p align="center">
  I₂ = E * (L₂ / L₁),
</p>

<p>Where <b>L₂</b> is the length at which the potentiometer balances the voltage across the resistor.</p>

<p>Finally, the error in the ammeter reading can be calculated as the difference between the observed current from the ammeter (<b>I₁</b>) and the true current measured with the potentiometer (<b>I₂</b>):</p>

<p align="center">
  ΔI = I₂ − I₁.
</p>

<h3>2. Calibration of Voltmeter:</h3>

<p>The calibration of a voltmeter is done to ensure its readings are accurate. Errors in voltmeter readings can arise due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mechanical errors, such as manufacturing defects.</li>
  <li>Parallax errors.</li>
  <li>Asymmetry in the voltmeter’s spring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a potentiometer can help increase the accuracy of the voltmeter’s readings by providing a more precise measure of potential difference. The process of calibrating the voltmeter with a potentiometer involves the following steps:</p>

<p>First, the primary circuit (which consists of the potentiometer, standard cell, and resistance box) is set up. The positive terminal of the standard cell is connected to point A in the secondary circuit (the high potential end). The negative terminal is connected to the first terminal of a two-way key.</p>

<p>The voltmeter to be calibrated is connected across the resistance box, while a galvanometer is connected to the central terminal of the two-way key. The other end of the galvanometer is connected to a jockey.</p>

<p>After completing the primary circuit as shown, insert the plug between terminals 1 and 2. The balancing length for the standard cell (denoted as <b>Eₛ</b>) is found by noting the point where the potentiometer wire balances this EMF. The potential gradient, <b>k</b>, is calculated using the relation:</p>

<h4>                     
<p align="center">
  k = Eₛ / L₀,
</p>
</h4>

<p>Where <b>L₀</b> is the balancing length corresponding to the standard cell.</p>

<p>Next, remove the plug between terminals 1 and 2 and insert it between terminals 2 and 3. Adjust the resistance in the resistance box and use the rheostat to adjust the current flowing through the circuit. Record the voltmeter's deflection (<b>Vv</b>). Since this reading is likely inaccurate, the correct potential difference is found using the potentiometer by determining the balancing length <b>L₂</b>.</p>

<p>The actual value of the potential difference can be calculated using:</p>

<h4>                     
<p align="center">
  V′ = k * L₂,
</p>
</h4>

<p>Where <b>k</b> is the potential gradient found earlier.</p>

<p>The error in the voltmeter’s reading can then be calculated by comparing the measured voltage <b>V</b> and the true value <b>V′</b>:</p>

<h4>                     
<p align="center">
  ΔV = V − V′.
</p>
</h4>

<p>Using the resistance box and rheostat, different voltmeter values can be observed, and the corresponding potential differences can be measured using the potentiometer. The difference between the voltmeter reading and the potentiometer's value is used to determine the calibration error.</p>
